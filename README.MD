<h3>IDEA</h3>:

On our computers we set wallpapers, themes, icons, customize browser's borders, etc. But what about bookmarks? Usually 99% of browsers just give to us a blank page with "Search" and blocks with icons of our bookmarks. With this project we can solve it.

Here we can integrate our own customized "Search", customized buttons, any colors, animations, battery status etc.

You can fully customize it by yourself and send it back to my email, if you want to share your own bookmark page in this repository. In this repository we can publich our nice good-looking templates.

If we will get a lot of different templates from our community, maybe we will create a own repository for this project + Reddit forum. Let's move aesthetics to a new level! ')


HOW TO USE IT:

Just edit it how you want and set it as a default page in your browser. If you can't set a html file as a default page, just install Apache, and to localhost set your html file. Then in your browser set localhost as a default page.
